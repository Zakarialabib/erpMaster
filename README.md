# ERPMASTER - LARAVEL TALLSTACK ECOM AND MULTIWAREHOUSE PROJECT
 
This Project is still in experimental phase and has a lot of issues, i wanted to make as perfect as possible sadly this period my time is full.

Just to put you in the perspective, this is a mix between 2 projects i had, MystockMaster for inventory and Laravel Ecommerce a shopping cart project, they were both in Livewire v2 , the project runs on Livewire V3 , which is far more better in terms of speed, security and other upgraded features.
